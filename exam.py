# ### Exercise 1 (max 2 points)
#
# The file [bird_foo_data.csv](./bird_foo_data.csv) dataset contains the data from all fox diet studies that were analysed to generate the frequency of occurrence of birds in fox diets across Australia. The data come from: 
# Stobo-Wilson, A., Murphy, B., Legge, S., Caceres-Escobar, H., Chapple, D., Crawford, H., Dawson, S., Dickman, C., Doherty, T., Fleming, P., Garnett, S., Gentle, M., Newsome, T., Palmer, R., Rees, M., Ritchie, E., Speed, J., Stuart, J.-M., Suarez-Castro, A., â€¦ Woinarski, J. (2022). Counting the bodies: estimating the numbers and spatial variation of Australian reptiles, birds and mammals killed by two invasive mesopredators [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bk3j9kdcz)
#
# Read the dataset in a DataFrame `birds`, use the ID column as the index.
#
#
# Columns: subheadings:
# - taxon: the taxon group that the dataset relates to
# - type: specifies whether the diet data was collected from fox scat or fox stomach samples or both
# - p_scat: the proportion of fox diet data that was collected from fox scats relative to fox stomachs
# - samples: the number of individual fox diet samples that were collected
# - total_in: the total number of individuals identified from fox stomach diet samples 
# - mean_in: the mean number of individuals identified per fox stomach from all fox diet stomach 	samples
# - map: mean annual precipitation at the study location where fox diet samples were collected 
# - mat: mean annual temperature at the study location where fox diet samples were collected
# - cover: mean tree cover at the study location where fox diet samples were collected
# - rugged: topographic ruggedness at the study location where fox diet samples were collected

birds: pd.DataFrame
birds = pd.read_csv('bird_foo_data.csv', index_col='ID')
birds.head()

birds['type'].unique()

# ### Exercise 2 (max 4 points)
#
# Compute the number of samples collected in the scat and in the stomach. When the `type` column is "both (not stated)" or "scat & stomach" use the value of `p_scat` to distribuite the samples between the two types (float values are ok). To get the full marks do not use explicit loops.

only_scat = birds[birds['type'] == 'scat']
only_stomach = birds[birds['type'].str.lower() == 'stomach']
both = birds[(birds['type'] != 'scat') & (birds['type'].str.lower() != 'stomach')]
assert len(only_scat) + len(only_stomach) + len(both) == len(birds)

import math
scat_samples = only_scat['samples'].sum() + (both['samples']*both['p_scat']).sum()
stomach_samples = only_stomach['samples'].sum() + (both['samples']*(1 - both['p_scat'])).sum()
assert math.isclose(scat_samples + stomach_samples, birds['samples'].sum())
print(f'There {scat_samples:.2f} scat samples and {stomach_samples:.2f} stomach samples.')


# ### Exercise 3 (max 7 points)
#
# Define a function which takes a takes a `pd.Series` (of integers) and it compute a (shorter) one with the sums of subsequent triplets of values.
# For example if the series contains the values 1,2,3,4,5 the result should be a series with 6,9,12.
#
# To get the full marks, you should declare correctly the type hints (the signature of the function) and add a doctest string.

def sum_subseq_triplets(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    """Compute a new Series with the sums of subsequent triplets of values.

    >>> all(sum_subseq_triplets(pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5])) == pd.Series([6,9,12]))
    True

    """
    result = pd.Series(np.zeros(len(s)-2, dtype=s.dtype))
    for i in range(len(s)-2):
        result.iloc[i] = s.iloc[i:i+3].sum()
    return result



import doctest
doctest.testmod()

# ### Exercise 4 (max 2 points)
#
# Apply the function define in Exercise 3 to column `samples`. To get the full marks do not use explicit loops.

sum_subseq_triplets(birds['samples'])

# ### Exercise 5 (max 5 points)
#
# Make a copy of the DataFrame `birds` in which every row with `type` "both (not stated)" or "scat & stomach" is duplicated: one row should have
# type "scat" and the other "stomach", the `samples` and `total_in` (if is not n/a) are distributed according to `p_scat`. Use only integer numbers for the samples and be sure the sum of samples is preserved for each pair of duplicated rows.

        birds_tuples.append(t)

        stomach = int(np.round(t.samples*(1 - t.p_scat)))
        assert scat + stomach == t.samples
        birds_tuples.append(t._replace(samples=scat, type='scat', total_in=t.total_in*t.p_scat))
        birds_tuples.append(t._replace(samples=stomach, type='stomach', total_in=t.total_in*(1-t.p_scat)))
birds_copy = pd.DataFrame(birds_tuples)
assert birds_copy['samples'].sum() == birds['samples'].sum()
assert birds_copy['total_in'].sum() == birds['total_in'].sum()

# ### Exercise 6 (max 4 points)
#
# Add to the DataFrame birds a column with the standardized value of `total_in`. Remember that the standardized value measures how many standard deviations a specific value is far from the mean. If you have a ndarray of values `xx`: `(xx - xx.mean())/xx.std()`. Then plot a density histogram of this new column. 

birds['std_total_in'] = (birds['total_in'] - birds['total_in'].mean()) / birds['total_in'].std() 


_ = birds['std_total_in'].hist(density=True, bins='auto')

# ### Exercise 7 (max 4 points)
#
#
# Plot a matrix of scatter plots (for each pair a,b you can plot just a,b and leave b,a empty) of all the combinations of `map`, `mat`, `cover`, `rugged`. They should appear all in the same figure. Put also a proper title to each plot.

features = ['map', 'mat', 'cover', 'rugged']
fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=len(features)-1, nrows=len(features)-1, figsize=(12,12))

            ax[i][j-1].scatter(birds[f1], birds[f2])
            ax[i][j-1].set_title(f'{f1} vs. {f2}')

            ax[i][j-1].set_ylabel(f2)
fig.tight_layout()

# ### Exercise 8 (max 5 points)
#
# Consider this statistical model: 
#
# - the parameter $\alpha$ is normally distributed with mean 0, and stdev 3
# - the parameter $\beta$ is normally distributed with mean 0, and stdev 5
# - the parameter $\sigma$ is exponentially distributed with $\lambda = 1$
# - the mean of the observed value of `map` is given by $\alpha + \beta\cdot C$ where C is the observed value of `cover`, its std deviation is $\sigma$ 
#
# Use PyMC to sample the posterior distributions after having seen the actual values for `map`.  Plot the posterior.

with pm.Model() as m:
    a = pm.Normal('alpha', 0, 3)
    b = pm.Normal('beta', 0, 5)
    s = pm.Exponential('sigma', 1)

    pm.Normal('map', mu=a + b*birds['cover'], sigma=s, observed=birds['map'])

with m:
    idata = pm.sample()

_ = az.plot_posterior(idata)
